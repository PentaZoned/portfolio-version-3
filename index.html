                My name is Bradley Le. I was born and raised in Hayward, CA. I live in a very diverse urban
                community.

                Ever since I was young, I would be interested in technology. I remember being four years old and
                pressing random buttons on a keyboard just because I was interested in what it does. I had constant
                access to computers so I developed a deep interest in a future occupation that would involve around
                the use of a computer. During my time in college, I narrowed my interests to web developer and UI/UX
                designer because I enjoy visually seeing my work and how it affects users. Naturally, I decided to
                choose web developer as a more hands-on, technical occupation to persue.
